# Windows10Warning

## Overview

This program is a Windows Forms application that notifies users about the upcoming end-of-life for Windows 10. The notification prompts users to take action, either by upgrading their system or scheduling a consultation with IT.

## Key Features
* 🚀 Persistent Notification: Pops up a warning message reminding users to upgrade Windows 10.
* 🔗 Actionable Button: Opens a customizable upgrade scheduling URL in the user’s default browser.
* ❌ Dismiss for the Day: Users can click “Dismiss”, and the notification will not reappear until the next day.
* 📁 Configuration Support: Uses a config.json file to define the title, URL, and logo dynamically.
* 🔍 Auto-Closing Logic: If dismissed, the app automatically closes on launch without showing the notification.
* 🖼 Custom Branding: Displays an organization-specific logo from a local file.

## How It Works
1. On Startup:
	* The app checks if a dismissal file exists (Win10NotificationDismissed.txt in AppData).
	* If the file contains today’s date, the app closes immediately.
	* If no dismissal file exists or the date is outdated, the notification appears.
2. User Options:
	* Click “Schedule an Upgrade” → Opens the configured upgrade scheduling URL.
	* Click “Dismiss” → Saves today’s date to prevent the notification from showing again until the next day.
3. Reopens Every 30 Minutes (via Scheduled Task)
	* If the notification was dismissed, it won’t appear again until the next day.
	* If not dismissed, it continues reminding users every 30 minutes (or as configured).

## Customization
*595px, 254px - Current size of the logo*
* config.json allows easy customization:
```
{
    "FormTitle": "Windows 10 Upgrade Required",
    "RedirectUrl": "https://your-it-support-portal.com",
    "LogoPath": "logo.png"
}
```
* Deployable via Scheduled Task to run on login and every 30 minutes.

## Deployment
* The .exe should be placed in the All Users Startup Folder (C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\).
* The config.json file will need to be located next to the .exe
* A PowerShell script can create a Scheduled Task to launch the app at login and every 30 minutes, included in the repository, OR you can use GPO.
